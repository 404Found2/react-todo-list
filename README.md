# React To-Do List
## View Live Demo
A live demo of this application can be found at: https://404found2.github.io/react-todo-list/
## Inspiration and What It Does 
This is my first react project, and thus its simplicity. I wanted to explore react hooks and state to solve a real-world problem (organizing tasks). This is a simple react app that allows users to add and delete tasks, saving changes by storing data via local starage.

## How I Built It
This is a simple react app that allows users to add and delete tasks. The main language used to develop this app was React as well as CSS for styling.

## Challenges I Ran Into
Some of the challenges we ran into:
- Managing state across different elements: the parent container mantained the state and passed functions as props so child containers can update state accordingly.

## Accomplishments That I'm Proud Of
- Use of localhost to save user data between page refreshes
- Ensuring State Immutability and Identical updates of States and Localhost

## What's Next?
I would like to integrate bootstrap into future projects, allowing for faster designing and an increased importance core react components!
I would also like to create a more complex, usable project, harnessing these newly learned skills.
